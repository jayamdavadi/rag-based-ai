 I am teaching few programming languages in 10 minutes tutoriols. Here are 
video subtitle chunks containing video title ,video number,start time in seconds, 
end time in seconds, text at that time:

{"title":{"253":"Learn Java Language In 10 Minutes","256":"Learn Java Language In 10 Minutes","255":"Learn Java Language In 10 Minutes","258":"Learn Java Language In 10 Minutes","257":"Learn Java Language In 10 Minutes"},"number":{"253":"05","256":"05","255":"05","258":"05","257":"05"},"start_time":{"253":10.0,"256":40.0,"255":30.0,"258":60.0,"257":50.0},"end_time":{"253":20.0,"256":50.0,"255":40.0,"258":70.0,"257":60.0},"text":{"253":"Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and his team.

"where is java taught"
User asked this question related to video chunks, you have to answer where and how much content 
is taught where (in which video and what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that perticular video.
If user ask unrelated questions tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course.
